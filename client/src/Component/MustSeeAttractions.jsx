            <h4 className="text-xl text-amber-800 mb-2">Ranthambore Fort</h4>
            <p>
              Ranthambore Fort, which is in a national park, has stories that go
              back more than a thousand years. This beautiful building was built
              about 944 AD and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of
              the most interesting destinations to visit. It used to be a
              prominent Rajput fortress and has been ruled by several rulers and
              dynasties. It was then added to the Jaipur royal estate, and the
              forest around it was used as their private hunting range. You can
              see the park from the top of the fort, which is a great mix of
              history and nature in one view.

            <h4 className="text-xl text-amber-800 mb-2">Bakula Region</h4>
            <p>
              Bakula is the best place to go if you want to see a tiger.
              It&apos;s one of the prettiest portions of Ranthambore, with lots
              of thick plants, natural waterholes, and quiet spots where animals
              like to hang out. There is a good possibility you will encounter a
              tigress with her pups here. Even if you don&apos;t, the beautiful
              forest and quiet surroundings make it a great place to take
              pictures and go on nature walks.

            <h4 className="text-xl text-amber-800 mb-2">Jogi Mahal</h4>
            <p>
              Jogi Mahal used to be a royal rest home for the kings of Jaipur.
              It is next to the beautiful Padam Lake and has a great view of the
              jungle around it. It feels like a storybook place, and it&apos;s
              really quiet. An enormous banyan tree, which is considered to be
              the second largest in India, stands right next to it. This makes
              the backdrop much more beautiful.

              Trinetra Ganesha Temple
            </h4>
            <p>
              The famous Trinetra Ganesha Temple, which is dedicated to the rare
              three-eyed incarnation of Lord Ganesha, sits immediately inside
              the fort. This Ganesha temple in India is one of the holiest
              because of a sweet tradition: every day, thousands of people
              submit letters to Lord Ganesha asking for his blessing on major
              events. The priests read each letter out loud to the god, which
              makes the place feel both sacred and personal.

            <h4 className="text-xl text-amber-800 mb-2">Kachida Valley</h4>
            <p>
              Kachida Valley is noted for its rugged beauty. It has steep hills,
              little valleys, and scattered ravines surrounded by green trees.
              It&apos;s hidden away at the edge of the park. This is where you
              might see panthers, sloth bears, and other hard-to-find species.
              It&apos;s quieter because it&apos;s not on the main tourist
              routes, which makes it perfect for anyone who likes to explore
              less-traveled paths. You can only get there by taking a jeep
              safari, which makes the trip more exciting.
