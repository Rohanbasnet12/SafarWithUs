            <span>Core Zones - </span>The Tadoba Core Zone is the heart of
            Tadoba National Park, famous for its dense forests, abundant
            biodiversity, and frequent tiger sightings. This zone represents the
            true wilderness of the park, with no human habitation allowed. It is
            a crucial area where wildlife and natural resources are carefully
            conserved and protected by the forest department. The entry gates to
            the Tadoba Core Zone include Moharli, Kolara, Khutwanda, Navegaon,
            Zari, and Pangadi.

            <span>Buffer Zones -</span> The buffer zone, surrounding the core area of Tadoba
            National Park is the forested area where villages coexist with
            wildlife and play a crucial role in involving local villagers in
            tourism. The buffer zones too offer excellent opportunities for
            wildlife sightings. Unlike the core zone, the buffer zone remains
            accessible to tourists year-round, including the monsoon season. The
            entry gates of Tadoba buffer zones are - Agarari, Devada-Adegaon,
            Ramdegi, Navegaon, Madnapur, Mamla, Pangadi Aswal Chuha Gate,
