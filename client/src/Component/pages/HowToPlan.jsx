            </p>
            <h5>Fleshing out Wish list</h5>
            <p>
              There are many sightseeing ideas or references coming up
              repeatedly as you researched your destination. Having them on your
              brainstorming list is a great start! When you've changed your mind
              about something, you can take it off the list if you really want
              to, otherwise, keep it.
            </p>
            <h5>Activity Research</h5>
            <p>
              If you are going Tadoba National Park then you should aware of
              their USP and you must be known to the fact about jeep safari in
              Tadoba. This is must activity and I do not think it should not be
              in your list in any manner when it comes to things to do.
            </p>
            <h5>Building Itinerary</h5>
            <p>
              You can build your itinerary as well. Apart from our Tadoba tour
              packages you can have your tour customization through our agent.
              They will make new according to your wishes.
            </p>

            <h5>Suitable Clothing</h5>
            <p>
              Suitable clothing for safari is must as wild animals are allergic
              to few colors. So you should not opt for bright colors. Soft and
              subtle color will work best for the jungle safari.
            </p>
            <h5>Seasonal Pick</h5>
            <p>
              The best thing can be that you plan your trip and its all
              essentials according to the season. The things vary season to
              season so whatever you are packing keep in your mind first thing
              that in which season you are going for Tadoba National Park tour.
