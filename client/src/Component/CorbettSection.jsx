                  1. Pick the Best Time to Go
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The best time to go to Ranthambore is between October and
                  June. During these months, the park is still green and full of
                  activity, making it an excellent place to see animals. During
                  the monsoon season (July to September), zones 1 to 5 are
                  closed, while zones 6 to 10 are open. This is a great time to
                  visit Ranthambore if you want to see it in a quieter, greener
                  setting.

                  2. Make a reservation for your stay ahead of time
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Ranthambore is a popular place to visit, and hotels fill up
                  rapidly, especially during the busiest times. There are places
                  to stay for every type of traveler, from cheap lodges to fancy
                  rainforest resorts. You can get the greatest location and
                  price by booking early.

                  3. Pick the Right Safari Option
                </h4>
                <p>
                  There are two kinds of safaris in the park: the Jeep Safari,
                  which can hold six people, and the Canter Safari, which can
                  hold twenty people. Canters are better for groups or families,
                  while Jeeps are better for individuals. Pick one based on how
                  comfortable you are, how many people are in your group, and
                  how much money you have.

                  4. Get your entry permits
                </h4>
                <p>
                  All safaris require entry permits. You can book them online
                  through the official website or have your tour operator do it
                  for you. There aren&apos;t many permits available, so
                  it&apos;s important to get them as soon as possible.

                  5. Accompanying a Nature Guide
                </h4>
                <p>
                  A licensed nature guide will travel with you on your safari,
                  and that&apos;s a good thing! They know the park like the back
                  of their hand, can readily tell animals and birds apart, and
                  can help you see tigers more often.

                  6. Pack Essentials
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Make sure your luggage is light but useful. Don&apos;t forget
                  your hat, sunscreen, camera, binoculars, insect repellent,
                  comfortable shoes, and a water bottle that you can fill up
                  again. It can be cold on early morning safaris, so bring a
                  light jacket.
