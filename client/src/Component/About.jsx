              Satpura National Park is the best place to go for a tranquil
              wildlife experience without tourists around. This hidden gem in
              Madhya Pradesh is not at all like the bustling, jeep-filling
              routes of their more popular parks. Underneath the canopy of
              trees, so peaceful is it that you can really hear wild sounds
              without competing with the roaring engines of tourists. The
              scenery is mesmerizing with dramatic hilly ridges, gorges carved
              over time and gentle running slow streams. Established in 1981,
              Satpura stretched across a vast protected area and is famous not
              only for how easy it makes spotting wildlife, but for the quality
              of the sightings. The park’s undiscovered mystique stems from its
              location in the heart of the ancient Satpura mountain range,
              revealing hidden treasures with every bend you take. Be it while
              venturing into its core zone, or placing your buffer of forest
              between you and the world, a rich tapestry of flora and fauna will
              provide a peaceful backdrop. For the travelers who long for a more
              authentic, solitude-tinged wilderness experience in India, Satpura
              is a rare peace-filled sanctuary all to himself to disappear to.

              Satpura National Park, known locally as Madhai, sits at the center
              of India&apos;s natural heritage and is much more than a tiger
              reserve; it is a vibrant, ancient landscape. Being one of the
              oldest reserve forests of the country , it is an essential part of
              the first biosphere reserve of Madhya Pradesh. Its name, which
              means “seven hills” in Sanskrit, reflects its rugged, diverse
              landscape of stunning sandstone formations, cascading waterfalls,
              dense sal and teak forests. This unique terrain forms a special
              basin between two great rivers and harbors a wildlife also rare
              for the area. Satpura is a favorite among birdwatchers and its
              reservoirs and grasslands are home to more than 300 species,
              including some colorful migratory visitors. The rich fabric of the
              park extends even beyond such famous mammals to include myriad
              medicinal plants and rare animals. It is this perfect blend of
              unspoilt beauty, ecological importance and abundance that makes a
              Satpura for all seasons and a Satpura for any nature lover and a
              Satpura for every nature lover.
